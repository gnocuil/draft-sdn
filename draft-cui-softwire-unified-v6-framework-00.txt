      Unified IPv6 Transition Framework With Flow-based Forwarding
               draft-cui-softwire-unified-v6-framework-01

Abstract

   This document describes a unified IPv6 transition framework.  This
   framework makes use of the flow-based packet forwarding technology,
   which can simplify the implementation of both control plane and data
   plane operations of transition mechanisms.  The purpose of this work
   is to provide an integrated and flexible framework to implement and
   deploy the most popular translation and tunneling mechanisms, such as
   MAP-E, Lightweight 4over6, DS-Lite, NAT64 etc.  This framework can
   benefit the industry by reducing the cost of implementation,
   providing flexibility for deployment, and allowing transition
   mechanisms to coexist and cooperate in the common infrastructure.

1.  Introduction

   Currently several translation and tunneling mechanisms have been
   proposed, such as NAT64 [RFC6146], DS-Lite [RFC6333], Lightweight
   4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] and MAP-E
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map].  These mechanisms have been or being
   implemented by the industry.  However, the suitable transition
   mechanisms may change along the ISP's transition period.  It's
   complicated and a big cost to upgrade existing devices to support new
   mechanisms.

   This document describes a unified IPv6 transition framework.  This
   framework adopts flow-based packet forwarding technology on
   transition devices, which can simplify the implementation of both
   control plane and data plane operations of transition mechanisms.
   The forwarding rules of transition devices are controlled by
   centrallized Controller and can be changed easily, thus this

   framework can cover all existing transition scenarios, e.g.  IPv4
   over IPv6 hub and spoke model that MAP-E or DS-Lite does.  This
   framework can benefit the industry by reducing the cost of
   implementing and deploying transition mechanisms.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Customer Premises Equipment Switch (CPE Switch):  A dual-stack L3
                            switch that performs the flow-based packet
                            forwarding function.  It can be the home
                            gateway or BNG.

   Border Relay Switch (BR Switch):  A dual-stack L3 switch that
                            performs the flow-based packet forwarding
                            function.  It is on the boarder of the ISP
                            network and IPv4/ IPv6 Internet.

   Controller:              A centrallized manager that controls both
                            CPE Switch and BR Switch.  Controller can be
                            a single device or a cluster of devices.

   Flow-based Packet Forwarding:  A function that forwards packets
                            according to the forwarding rules specified
                            by a flow table.  A typical forwarding rule
                            includes a match field and a action set.
                            The match field specifies a certain flow,
                            which is a set of packets that share some
                            common features (e.g. same source and
                            destionation address).  The action set
                            specifies the actions that should act on the
                            certain flow (e.g. forward, encapsulate, or
                            IP translate).

3.  Framework Overview

   The architecture of the proposed unified IPv6 transition framework is
   illustrated in Figure 1.  The customer LAN connects the IPv6 ISP
   network through CPE Switch.  The ISP Network accesses the Internet
   through BR Switch.  Devices in the ISP Network are not required to be
   managed by the Controller, thus the operator only needs to upgrade
   the CPEs and BRs.

                      Figure 1 Architecture Overview

   Both CPE Switch and BR Switch perform flow-based forwarding, and are
   managed by the Controller.  Since CPE Switch can work as a gateway of
   the customer network, it also needs to support traditional CPE
   function, such as DHCPv4 server and be compatible with [RFC7084].

   Controller is responsible for controlling the forwarding behavior of
   both CPE Switch and BR Switch.  Controller can be an individual
   device or a cluster of devices.  The Controller configures the
   forwarding rules in the flow tables maintained by the CPE Switch and
   BR Switch according to the packets passed from Switches.

   Controller communicates with Switch using protocols that is able to
   carry flow information and flow table configuration, such as Openflow
   [OpenFlow].

4.  Control Plane Behavior

   The Controller configures both CPE Switch and BR Switch through flow
   configuration.  The switches are configured or pre-installed with
   default forwarding policy that forwards all unknown flows to the
   controller.  The controller then installs a forwarding rule for the
   specific flow into the switch.  All remaining packets of the same
   flow are processed based on this rule and will not be forwarded to
   the Controller.  The definition of a flow depends on the forwording
   policy.  For example, in MAP-E or Lightweight 4over6 scenario, the BR
   Switch treats all traffic from the same sender as a single flow.

   Some transition mechanisms require provisioning parameters to CPE.
   For example, DS-Lite, MAP-E and Lightweight 4over6 use DHCPv6 to
   provision IPv6 address of AFTR/BR to CPE.  Lightweight 4over6
   provision IPv6 address and ports to CPE.  Since these parameters can
   be represented by flow forwarding rules, in this framework such
   DHCPv6 based provisioning is not required.  Instead these softwire

   configuration are embeded into forwarding rules and provisioned to
   CPE Switch through flow configuration.  The device configuration that
   flow-based configuration doesn't support is still required, such as
   DHCPv6 prefix delegation.

5.  Data Plane Behavior

   When receiving an incoming packet that doesn't have a match in the
   flow table (the intial packet of a new flow), CPE Switch and BR
   Switch MUST forward the packet to Controller.  Controller MUST
   determine how to proceed the flow (e.g.  IP tunneling encapsluaton/
   decapuslutaion, IP translation, etc.), and interpret the process into
   a set of forwarding rule configurations.  Controller then installs
   these configurations to CPE Swtich and BR Switch.  When receiving the
   subsequent packets of the flow, CPE Switch and BR Switch will apply
   the same actions to them, according to the forwarding rules in the
   flow table.

   Both CPE Switch and BR Switch MUST support the IPv6 tunneling
   encapsulation/decapuslation function required in [RFC6333],
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] and [I-D.ietf-softwire-map].  To support
   IPv4/IPv6 translation scenarios such as NAT64, the switch MUST
   support IPv4/IPv6 packet translation function.  These functions can
   be implemented either as processing actions in flow forwarding rules,
   or as standalone modules and provide a virtual interface to the
   switch module.

   In MAP-E/Lightweight 4over6 CPE and DS-Lite AFTR, NAT44 is required.
   In this framework, NAT44 can be simply supported by flow-based
   forwarding rules.  Since typical flow-based forwarding mechanism
   support procotol header modification, e.g. set-field action in
   OpenFlow, NAT44 can be implemented as modification of source/
   destination IPv4 addresseses and ports.  In this case, the flows are
   identified by 5-tuples and the first packet of each flow is passed to
   the Controller.  NAT44 can also be implemented as a standlone
   function into switches, in this case passing the first packet of each
   5-tuple flow to controller is not needed.

5.1.  Port-Set Based Matching

   Since MAP-E/Lightweight 4over6 requires port-based IPv4 address
   sharing, there may be thousands of ports in the same IPv4 address
   allocated to the same CPE.  To reduce the amount of forwarding rules
   in BR Switch, when BR Switch matching an incoming packet, it MUST
   support the port-set based matching as defined in in Section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map].  If the BR Switch is an OpenFLow Switch, it
   MUST support and accept match field masking for ports (see section
   7.2.2.5 of [OpenFlow]).

6.  Example: MAP-E/Lightweight 4over6 mode

   This section discusses how to run MAP-E/Lightweight 4over6 mode in
   this framework.  In this mode, The Customer LAN is an IPv4 or dual-
   stack network, and the ISP Network is an IPv6 network.  Initially the
   CPE Switch is configured with IPv6 address through DHCPv6 Prefix
   Delegation and connects to the Controller.  The CPE Switch passes all
   unknown packets to the Controller.

   The Controller manages the binding between IPv4 addresses and IPv6
   addresses.  When a new CPE Switch connects to the Controller, the
   Controller allocates a preserved or new IPv4 address and a port set
   for the CPE Switch, by install one or two (for bi-directory)
   forwarding rule(s) in BR Switch.  In case that CPE's NAT44 stated is
   maintained in Controller, when received an unknown packet from CPE
   Switch, the Controller pick one port from the port set of the CPE
   Switch and installs the forwarding rule in the CPE Switch.  Both
   forwarding rules in CPE Switch and BR Switch include IPv4-in-IPv6
   tunneling encapsulation/decapuslation action.

   This framework supports mesh mode for Lightweight 4over6.  In mesh
   mode, CPE Switch (CPE1) sends every initial packet of each 5-tuple
   flow to Controller, and the Controller determines if the destination
   IPv4 address and port correspond to another CPE (CPE2).  If so, the
   destination IPv6 address of the encapsulation action for this flow is
   set to CPE2's IPv6 address instead of BR Switch's IPv6 address.

7.  Security Considerations

   As Switch should always send unknown flows to Controller, the link
   between Switch and Controller might be vulnerable to a typical DoS
   attack, which is done by flooding new sessions and can exhaust all
   available resources of Switch and/or Controller.  Some monitoring or
   filtering approaches should be used to prevent against such an
   attack.  In addition, Controller can implement a policy that
   restricts the resource allocated to a Switch, or restricts the
   resource of Switch allocated to a flow.

   Further security consideration is TBD.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not include an IANA request.
